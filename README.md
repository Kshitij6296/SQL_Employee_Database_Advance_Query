# SQL_Employee_Database_Advance_Query

For this project, I analyzed the employee database of a company using intermediate to advanced level SQL queries. 

To showcase my analysis, I created a database containing multiple tables with approximately 10-15 records per table. 

I utilized various SQL techniques including Joins, Sub-queries, CTEs, Text functions, and more to perform a thorough 
examination of the data.
